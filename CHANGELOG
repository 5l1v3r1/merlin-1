git version
===========

  backend:
    - small memory leak fix
    - major improvements and bugfixes for locate (i.e. "jump to definition")

  emacs:
    - fixed bug preventing merlin restart ( #167 )
    - removed keybindings reserved to users ( #170 )
      the full list is:
        + `C-c l` previously bound to `merlin-use`
        + `C-c r` previously bound to `merlin-restart-process`
        + `C-c t` previously bound to `merlin-type-expr`
    - removed keybindings on `C-<up>` and `C-<down>` as these already have a
      meaning in emacs ( #129 )
      They were bound to `merlin-type-enclosing-go-up` and
      `merlin-type-enclosing-go-down` respectively.
    - the emacs mode is now compiled (contribution from Jacques-Pascal Deplaix
      #158 , with a follow up from Rudy Grinberg #165 )

  extensions:
    - added support for variantslib ( #132 )
    - updated fieldslib support ( #169 )

  vim:
    - the split method for locate can now be configured

merlin 1.5
==========
Sat Dec 14 19:45:06 CET 2013

  backend:
    - better handling of paths (both sources and build)
    - splitted build path into cmi and cmt path.
      New directives "CMI" and "CMT" are now available in .merlin files ("B"
      still works as previously)
    - doesn't get confused anymore when the user switch between buffers (the
      state is cleaned)

  emacs:
    - adds ability to enable/disable extensions manually
    - adds a command to clear all the errors from a buffer
    - displaying of errors can now be disabled

  extensions
    - updated bin_prot for version >= 109.45.00
    - bugfix for [with compare] in presence of parametrized types
    - added support for "here" (when activated adds
      [val _here_ : Lexing.position])
    - added support for [assert_lwt]
    - fixed typing of [while_lwt]

  vim:
    - vim plugin can be installed into a custom directory and has its own
      makefile target (contribution from Vsevolod Velichko)
    - added "ClearEnclosing" command to remove merlin's overlay after a call to
      TypeOf.

merlin 1.4.1
============
Thu Sep 26 21:29:56 BST 2013

  documentation: 
    - updates of the emacs section of the readme by Ronan Lehy.

  emacs:
    - bugfix for ac-mode: merlin-ac-prefix wasn't called.
    - better formatting for completion suggestions.

  vim:
    - bugfix for the "selectPhrase" command, an overflow on 32b plateform was
      causing complete desynchronisation between vim and merlin.
    - better formatting for completion suggestions.

merlin 1.4.0 
============
Tue Sep 24 23:02:04 BST 2013

  backend:
    - lazy processing of open directives makes merlin much faster
    - simplified buffer management
    - tweak signal handling to improve windows compatibility
    - track verbosity of query: repeated queries are considered more "verbose"
    - type expansion: expand type aliases for verbose query
    - add support for OUnit-like Benchmark extension
    - more tolerant type checker, to provide completion on ill-typed
      expressions
    - proper version reporting with git revision
    - refactored logging subsystem
    - add support "val constructs" in implementation: report errors but add
      definition to current environment
    - add FLG, EXT and PRJ in .merlin
    - "locate" command now works in much more situations
    - one distribution for 4.00 and 4.01, introduced common interface between
      both, typers now live in https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin-typers
    - new implementation of the main merlin state tracking ast & types
    - better error reporting thanks to a contribution from Ronan Lehy

  documentation:
    - started a wiki (https://github.com/def-lkb/merlin/wiki)
    - wrote 'from-scratch' guides to ease setting-up merlin in your editor

  emacs
    - during completion with auto-complete, you can hit C-c C-l on a candidate
      to jump on its definition
    - made communication with merlin asynchronous (using transfer queues) hence
      improving responsiveness
    - when running a merlin command, the errors present in all phrases but the
      current one are displayed
    - fixed buffer cleaning
    - successive call to C-c C-t do not climb the typed tree but improve merlin's
      verbosity. To move inside the tree use C-down and C-up (which implements
      phrase movement if there is no enclosing started).
    - customize data for merlin
    - refactoring and numerous bugfixes


merlin 1.3.1
============


  Minor release, but merlin is now compatible with ocaml versions > 4.00.1.
  The only noticeable changes since 1.3 is the use of short paths even with
  version 4.00.1 of ocaml.
